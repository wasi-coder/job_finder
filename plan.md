## Architecture
- **Frontend:** Flutter with Material Design
- **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore for data, Storage for images)
- **State Management:** Provider
- **Location:** Google Maps API for local job discovery
- **Ads:** AdMob integration
- **Payments:** Stripe or local BD payment gateway (if needed)
